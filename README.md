As some entries were missing from the data provided for the task, I decided to solve this as follows:

The Products.xlsx file with the product dictionary was missing the ID number 7, which appears in the main table (Sales). I manually added a row with ID number 7 and called it ‘N/A’ (not available) in order not to ignore the data present for this record and assuming that IDs numbered 8, 9 and 10 were correctly assigned.
